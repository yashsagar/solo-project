            <p>
              Located just outside the city, Chamundi Hills is home to the
              Chamundeshwari Temple, a popular pilgrimage site dedicated to the
              goddess Chamundeshwari. The temple is perched on the top of the
              hills and offers a panoramic view of Mysore. Visitors can also see
              the colossal statue of the Nandi bull, which is carved out of a
              single granite rock and is considered the largest of its kind in
              the world.
